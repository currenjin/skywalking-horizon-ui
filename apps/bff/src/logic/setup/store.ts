 * live in horizon's frontend (and a soon-to-come BFF defaults table) so
 * the stored JSON stays sparse and human-readable.
 *
 * Future swap-point: replace this implementation with one that writes
 * to OAP via `addTemplate` mutations under the `horizon-` prefix, once
 * horizon's runtime template format is ready and operators have
 * `core.enableUpdateUITemplate: true` flipped on. The interface below
 * is what callers code against.
