/**
 * Tiny per-process cache for the trace-protocol probe.
 *
 * OAP 9.6+ exposes `queryTraces` (v2) which returns the list AND
 * the spans inline in a single roundtrip. Older OAP only exposes
 * `queryBasicTraces` (v3) which returns trace summaries; the SPA
 * fetches each detail via `queryTrace(traceId)`.
 *
 * The v2 query type carries a sibling boolean `hasQueryTracesV2Support`
 * we can probe once and cache. Cached for 5 minutes so an OAP rollover
 * or a redeploy is picked up without an explicit reload.
 *
 * The decision is per OAP target (keyed by `statusUrl`) — when the
 * operator points horizon at a different cluster, the probe runs
 * again.
